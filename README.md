# ptj-cloud
## Why ptj-cloud?
Ptj-cloud is completly free, no fee's nothing!
## how does it works?
It makes use of the google realtime database, 
First the file is converted in base64 with js, and it uploads that to the db.
When the file has a requested download the base64 is getting coverted to binary code, and it downloads that!
## is it safe? 
it is relatively safe, everyone can view the Database but, 
Your email,password is stored in sha256 so its not easy to crack. 
for example the hacker want files from me, then he needs to know the sha256 code off my email, so its not easy to crack



### !!  its recommended to not use your real email to keep it safe as possible  !!
