## Why ptj-cloud?
Ptj-cloud is completly free, no fee's nothing!
## how does it works?
It makes use of the google realtime database, 
First the file is converted in base64 with js, and it uploads that to the db.
When the file has a requested download the base64 is getting coverted to binary code, and it downloads that!
## is it safe? 
it is relatively safe, because everyone can view the Database but, 
Your email is stored in sha256 so its not easy to crack. 
for example the hacker want files from me, then he first need to put my username / email in sha256 and then get my files.



## !!its recommended to not use your real email to keep it safe as possible!!
